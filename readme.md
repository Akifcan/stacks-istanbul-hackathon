- **StackLit | Spend to Stack** is a seamless way to turn your everyday spending into automated STX savings. Without any sign-up or complicated setup, users instantly get a Stacks wallet, link their credit card, and set simple rules—like “when I spend 500 TL, add 5 STX to my wallet.” Every time a user spends, StackLit automatically invests according to their instructions, helping them grow their crypto holdings effortlessly while they shop.

- This project is a **mobile application** built with **React Native** and integrated with **blockchain via Clarity smart contracts**. It allows users to manage their investments, track STX token balances, and interact with smart contracts securely.
